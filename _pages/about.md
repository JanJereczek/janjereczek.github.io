My name is Jan Swierczek-Jereczek (insert joke about unpronouciable name). I am a PhD candidate at the Complutense University of Madrid, funded by a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action. I mostly study past and future abrupt changes of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and therefore focus largely on climate, glaciology and glacial isostatic adjustment. Furthermore, I am interested in applying concepts of nonlinear dynamics, control theory and machine learning to Earth system modelling and analysis.

Memes are a way to transcend the everyday life, so let's get a bit transcendental:

Climate models are central tools to answer questions related to paleoclimate and human-made climate change. However, they are quite often written in programming languages that are obsolete, like Fortran 77 (yes, 77 stands for 1977), which often results in codes that don't fully use modern functionalities. Disclaimer: I have nothing against Fortran and I am sure the 2023 version is gorgeous.

Astrophysics is a picturesque field of superlatives and keeps fascinating a wide audience, sometimes thanks to the numerous sci-fi movies starring dimension-bending objects. Spending time on studying our Earth has however shown me that everything that surrounds us deserves, at the very least, the same amount of gasping.

Partial differential equations are the most common way to describe geophysical processes. In some cases, they can be solved by using the Fast-Fourier Transform, which is arguably one of the most impactful algorithm.

It's easy to despise forms but there is something deeper to this. All senior scientists I know agree that the beaurocratical overhead has increased over the last decades. Apart from filling forms for them and for others, they are expected to research, teach, publish, travel and communicate on top of that. There is something flawed about this. Institutions are here to support their researchers, not drawn them in digitized paperwork that, until now, does not hold the promise of being more efficient.

I developped FastIsostasy, a model that regionally computes the solid-Earth deformation and changes in sea-level according to the load of ice and liquid water. 3D GIA models are the most accurate way to perform this computation but are 2 to 4 orders of magnitude slower than fastIsostasy. So what is FastIsostasy? Well something like a pink body suit.
