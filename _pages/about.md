My name is Jan Swierczek-Jereczek (insert joke about unpronouciable name). I am a PhD candidate at the Complutense University of Madrid, funded by a Marie-Sklodowska Action. I mostly study past and future abrupt changes of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and I therefore focus largely on climate, glaciology and glacial isostatic adjustment. Furthermore, I am interested in applying concepts of nonlinear dynamics, control theory and machine learning to Earth system modelling and analysis.
