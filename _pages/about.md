My name is Jan Swierczek-Jereczek (insert joke about unpronouciable name). I am a PhD candidate at the Complutense University of Madrid, funded by a Marie-Sklodowska Action. My main topic of study is the possibility of abrupt changes of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and I therefore focus largely on climate, glaciology, glacial isostatic adjustment and sea level.
