My name is Jan Swierczek-Jereczek (insert joke about unpronouciable name). I am a PhD candidate at the Complutense University of Madrid, funded by a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action. I mostly study past and future abrupt changes of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and therefore focus largely on climate, glaciology and glacial isostatic adjustment. Furthermore, I am interested in applying concepts of nonlinear dynamics, control theory and machine learning to Earth system modelling and analysis.

## Making a positive change in science

Science has historically been the playground of a priviliged demographic, to say the least. This is not only yet another pernicious expression of violence but also a big obstacle to science itself. The lack of diversity has led to truly insane theories, like craniometry. On the other hand, sound theories often served brutal purposes and geoscience was, in the first place, largely motivated by the extractivism of the colonial powers. Academics tend to cherish factual formulations and here goes mine: this is outright shit and needs to be changed. I hope to contribute to an inclusive, kind and therefore strong way of doing science.

## Strengthening the future of public science

Currently, a lot of faith is placed in the hand of private companies as drivers of the scientifical and technical progress. This results, for instance, in tax advantages that are usually motivated by the competition between countries in a global world. In essence, this is public funding given away without setting basic requirements like accountability, accessibility and democratic decision process. Public education and research remains the only way of making science ethical and transparent. As a matter of fact, it funds my daily work, which consist in publishing open-source (geo-)scientific software and open-access articles summarising the results obtained with my collaborators.
